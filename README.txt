Project Mayhem overview

This project is created as a testament as my ability to handle the following programming features:

1) Front end web development
This project aims to develop a simple front end game of sorts that's accessible via the web.

2) Data structure
Try implementing some data structures such as a score board to practice coding interviews more

3) Integration of projects
Integrate different aspects of the project together via intelligent engineering.

4) Marketing
My ability to create a presentation to tell people why they should use this project.

5) something else
I'm sure there will be other learning opportunities that will arise.
